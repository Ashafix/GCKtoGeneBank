//****************************************************************************//
//   This is the library file to use with GCK convert.
//
//   Comments can be added on a new line or after an entry, marked with: '//'
//   Groups are started by the keyword Group: (All processed groups are already
//      included in the file. Do NOT add any more).
//   Groups denote GeneBank keywords as seen below.
//   Entries should be always on a new line.
//   Entries can be preceded by the following tokens:
//          'C:' - this means that the part can be Contained within a name.
//          'P:' - this means that a regular expression is given.
//                 See: http://www.regular-expressions.info/ for more
//                 information about regular expressions.
//
//      Entries not preceded by a token are taken to mean that the name of the
//   feature must match exactly to be accepted within the group. Entries are not
//   case sensitive. Leading and trailing spaces are removed.
//
//   There is one special group: 'exclude'.
//   Any feature listed below this is, if found, excluded from the final
//   GeneBank file generated.
